# Functions whose *const u8 + u32 parameter pairs are native pointers,
# NOT WASM memory buffers. These need NativePtr (i64) pass-through.
#
# NOTE: spawn_actor, spawn_actor_deferred, finish_spawning are NOT overridden
# because the guest passes these buffers from Rust (WASM) memory — the host
# reads them via read_guest_bytes and forwards to the C++ API.
